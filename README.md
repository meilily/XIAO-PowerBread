## Key Features

1. **Real-Time Monitoring**: View essential power metrics at a glance‚Äîno multimeter needed. The built-in display shows real-time voltage, current, and power data.
2. **High-Current Output**: Deliver up to 1.5A of stable 3.3V power, ideal for most breadboard-based electronics projects.
3. **Built-in LCD Display**: Stay informed with real-time feedback‚Äîcritical power data is displayed clearly on the integrated LCD.
4. **Plug-and-Play Design**: Compatible with standard breadboards, simply plug in, power up, and start prototyping without extra setup.
5. **Open-Source and RP2040 Powered**: Powered by the RP2040, this open-source design provides flexibility for future extensions like USB-serial communication and PWM control.
6. **Dual-Channel Voltage and Current Sensing**: Equipped with the INA3221 sensor for dual-channel voltage and current monitoring‚Äîknow what‚Äôs happening with every aspect of your power supply.
7. **Compact Powerhouse**: This compact design delivers both 3.3V and 5V outputs, optimizing your breadboard space without compromising on power.
8. **Multiple UI functions**: The UI can be switched between data monitoring, line chart, and statistic mode.

## Getting Started

### Hardware

- **XIAO Board**: The XIAO RP2040 is recommended, though other XIAO boards should work as well.
- **XIAO PowerBread Board**: Clone or remix the design from this repository. Also you can get the hardware from [Tindie](https://www.tindie.com/products/35842/).
- **Breadboard**: Fits standard breadboards for easy prototyping.
- **Power Supply**: Use a standard USB power source.

### Software

- **Arduino Code**: Modify or remix the project using the provided Arduino source code.
  - This code is built on top of freeRTOS from the Arduino Pico SDK. It has 4 tasks:
    - Task for reading current sensors (INA3221).
    - Task for serial communication.
    - Task for data update to LCD.
    - Task for handling dial functions, such as changing the rotation of the UI.

- **Bin File**: For XIAO RP2040 users, download the precompiled bin file and flash it via UF2 for quick setup.


### Planned Software Features
- [x] Real-time current sensor data displayed on the LCD.
- [x] Dial wheel to adjust the UI for different viewing angles.
- [x] Line chart mode to visualize power usage for each channel.
- [x] Count mode to count average(second, minute, all time) and peak current consumption for each channel.
- [x] Allow to save settings data to EEPROM.
- [ ] USB-Serial mode for data transfer.
- [ ] PWM output on IO0 and IO1.
- [ ] ADC reading from IO0 and IO1.
